\title{Estimate Reference Noise Limits in Normalized Doppler Frequency}
\usage{
seasonder_estimateReferenceNoiseNormalizedLimits(seasonder_cs_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_obj}{A SeaSondeRCS object containing Doppler frequency metadata.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length two, representing the lower and upper reference
noise limits in normalized Doppler frequency.
}
\description{
This function estimates the reference noise limits for normalized Doppler frequencies
in a SeaSondeR cross-spectral object. These limits are used to define the frequency range
where the noise level is assessed for first-order region (FOR) detection.
}
\details{
The function computes the noise limits based on the maximum normalized Doppler frequency
from \code{\link{seasonder_getDopplerBinsFrequency}}. The limits are scaled using fixed
factors to set a reference range for noise analysis:
\itemize{
\item The lower bound is 56.5\% of the maximum normalized Doppler frequency.
\item The upper bound is 100\% of the maximum normalized Doppler frequency.
}

The lower bound value of 56.5\% was determined through an empirical process involving
multiple sample spectra. The procedure began with an initial lower bound set at 100\%,
and in each iteration, this value was decreased by 0.5\%. The noise floor was
calculated repeatedly and compared with the temporal NoiseFloor.txt file generated
by the AnalyseSpectra Tool in Radial Suite R8. The final lower bound percentage
was established as the value that closely matched the corresponding noise floor
in the NoiseFloor.txt file. After this, several percentages were averaged and
rounded to the nearest 0.5\%.

The function is used in first-order detection processes where noise reference levels
are required for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculations.
