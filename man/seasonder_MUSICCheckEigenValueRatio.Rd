\title{Validate Eigenvalue Ratio Using MUSIC Algorithm}
\usage{
seasonder_MUSICCheckEigenValueRatio(seasonder_cs_object)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_object}{A SeaSondeRCS object containing the MUSIC solutions and related data.}
}
\value{
The updated SeaSondeRCS object with the following modifications:
\itemize{
\item A new column \code{eigen_values_ratio} in the MUSIC data.
\item A logical column \code{P1_check} indicating whether each solution passes the P1 test.
\item Updated \code{retained_solution} values for solutions that fail the test.
}
}
\description{
This function implements the P1 test for solutions derived using the MUSIC algorithm.
The test checks the ratio between the largest and the second-largest eigenvalues, which
serves as an indicator of signal quality.
}
\details{
The P1 test is based on the ratio of the largest eigenvalue (\(\lambda_1\)) to the second-largest eigenvalue (\(\lambda_2\)):
[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}
]
This ratio is compared to a threshold defined in the MUSIC parameters to determine whether the solution
is considered valid. Solutions failing this test are marked as "single."
