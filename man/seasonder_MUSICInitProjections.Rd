\title{Initialize Projection Matrix for MUSIC Algorithm}
\usage{
seasonder_MUSICInitProjections(bearings = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{bearings}{A numeric vector representing the bearings (in degrees) for which projections are initialized.
Defaults to \code{0}.}
}
\value{
A \(2 \times n\) matrix of complex values, each initialized to \code{NA_complex_}, with row names
\code{"single"} and \code{"dual"}. The input bearings are stored as an attribute.
}
\description{
This function initializes a projection matrix for use in the MUSIC algorithm.
}
\details{
The function creates a \(2 \times n\) complex matrix, where \(n\) is the number of bearings.
The matrix rows are labeled:
\itemize{
\item \code{"single"}: For single projections.
\item \code{"dual"}: For dual projections.
}

An attribute \code{"bearings"} is attached to the matrix, storing the input bearings vector.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Initialize projections for default bearings
projections <- seasonder_MUSICInitProjections()
print(projections)

# Initialize projections for specific bearings
bearings <- seq(0, 360, by = 10)
projections <- seasonder_MUSICInitProjections(bearings)
print(projections)
}
}
