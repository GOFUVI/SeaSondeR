\title{Read and Quality Control a Single Field}
\usage{
read_and_qc_field(field_spec, connection, endian = "big")
}
\arguments{
\item{field_spec}{A list containing the specifications for the field to read.
It should contain:
\itemize{
\item \code{type}: the type of data to read, passed to \code{seasonder_readCSField}.
\item \code{qc_fun}: the name of a quality control function. As detailed in \code{seasonder_readSeaSondeCSFileBlock},
this function should be present in the shared environment \code{seasonder_the} and must accept
\code{field_value} as its first argument, followed by any other arguments specified in \code{qc_params}.
\item \code{qc_params}: a list of additional parameters to pass to the quality control function. See
\code{seasonder_readSeaSondeCSFileBlock} for detailed expectations of the QC function behavior.
}}

\item{connection}{A connection to the binary file.}

\item{endian}{A character string indicating the byte order. Options are "big" and "little" (default is "big").}
}
\value{
The value of the field after quality control. Can be the original value, a transformed value,
or NULL if the value fails quality control. The exact behavior of the quality control function, including
the handling of NULL values, is detailed in \code{seasonder_readSeaSondeCSFileBlock}.
}
\description{
This auxiliary function reads a field from a binary file using a provided specification and
applies a quality control function on the retrieved data. The expectations and functioning of the
quality control functions are described in detail in the documentation for \code{seasonder_readSeaSondeCSFileBlock}.
