\title{Calculate the Radar Wavelength}
\usage{
seasonder_getRadarWaveLength(seasonder_cs_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_obj}{A \code{SeaSondeRCS} object containing metadata about
the radar system, including its center frequency.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the radar wavelength in meters (m).
}
\description{
This function computes the radar wavelength based on the center frequency
of the SeaSonde radar system. The wavelength is derived using the speed of
light and the radar's center frequency.
}
\details{
The radar wavelength (\( \lambda \)) is calculated using the formula:
[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
]
where:
\itemize{
\item \( c \) is the speed of light (approximately \( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
\item \( f \) is the radar's center frequency in Hz, retrieved from the SeaSondeRCS object.
}

The center frequency is initially stored in MHz and is converted to Hz by multiplying
it by \( 10^6 \).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming `cs_object` is a valid `SeaSondeRCS` object
wavelength <- seasonder_getRadarWaveLength(cs_object)
print(wavelength)
}
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{seasonder_getCenterFreqMHz}} to retrieve the radar's center frequency.
