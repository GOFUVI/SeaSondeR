abstract = {{Processing the signals received on an array of sensors for the location of the emitter is of great enough interest to have been treated under many special case assumptions. The general problem considers sensors with arbitrary locations and arbitrary directional characteristics (gain/phase/polarization) in a noise/interference environment of arbitrary covariance matrix. This report is concerned first with the multiple emitter aspect of this problem and second with the generality of solution. A description is given of the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, which provides asymptotically unbiased estimates of 1) number of incident wavefronts present; 2) directions of arrival (DOA) (or emitter locations); 3) strengths and cross correlations among the incident waveforms; 4) noise/interference strength. Examples and comparisons with methods based on maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum entropy (ME), as well as conventional beamforming are included. An example of its use as a multiple frequency estimator operating on time series is included.}},

abstract = {{The authors consider methods for solving the problem of finding the directions of multiple plane waves with linear arrays of sensors and the related one of estimating the parameters of multiple superimposed exponential signals in noise. Specifically, the MUSIC and maximum-likelihood (ML) methods have been proposed for solving these problems. The authors study the performance of the MUSIC and ML methods, and analyze their statistical efficiency. They also derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the estimation problems mentioned above, and establish some useful properties of the CRB covariance matrix. The relationship between the MUSIC and ML estimators is investigated as well.<>}},

We also describe internal consistency checks including visual observation of the radial velocity map, consideration of the computed uncertainties and quantitative tests of radial velocities measured by two radars along the baseline between the systems. Baseline analysis is illustrated by application to two SeaSonde networks, with contrasting results that lead to a better understanding of SeaSonde output.}},
