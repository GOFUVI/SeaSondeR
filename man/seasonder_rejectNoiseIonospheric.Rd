\title{Apply Noise/Ionospheric Contamination Test to All Bragg Peaks}
\usage{
seasonder_rejectNoiseIonospheric(seasonder_cs_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_obj}{A \code{SeaSondeRCS} object containing the spectral data and FOR parameters.}
}
\value{
The updated \code{SeaSondeRCS} object with the filtered FOR bins.
}
\description{
This function evaluates and filters the First Order Region (FOR) detections across all range cells
by applying the noise/ionospheric contamination rejection test to both positive and negative Bragg regions.
}
\details{
\strong{Reason for the Test:}
This function ensures that Bragg peaks contaminated by excessive noise or ionospheric interference
are removed from the detected First Order Region (FOR). Peaks where the power in the surrounding
non-Bragg region exceeds the power in the Bragg region by a specified threshold are deemed invalid
and are rejected. This step is critical for maintaining the accuracy of radar-derived measurements.

\strong{Steps:}
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Retrieve Current FOR Data:}
\itemize{
\item Retrieves the detected FOR Doppler bin indices for all range cells using \code{\link{seasonder_getSeaSondeRCS_FOR}}.
}
\item \strong{Apply Noise/Ionospheric Rejection Test:}
\itemize{
\item Iterates over each range cell and evaluates both positive and negative Bragg regions.
\item Calls \code{\link{seasonder_rejectNoiseIonosphericTest}} to check each peak against the noise/ionospheric criterion.
\item Peaks that fail the test are removed (replaced with an empty vector).
}
\item \strong{Store Updated FOR Data:}
\itemize{
\item Updates the \code{SeaSondeRCS} object with the filtered FOR results using \code{\link{seasonder_setSeaSondeRCS_FOR}}.
}
}

\strong{Use Case:}
This function is particularly useful in environments where noise or ionospheric effects are prevalent,
ensuring that only valid first-order Bragg peaks are retained for further processing.
