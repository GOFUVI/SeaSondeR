\title{Trigger Restart for Skipping Transformation}
\usage{
seasonder_v6_skip_transformation(cond, value)
}
\arguments{
\item{cond}{The condition object that triggered the restart.}

\item{value}{The provided value to be used when the transformation is skipped.}
}
\value{
This function does not have a standard return value. Instead, it triggers a restart
that can be caught by an enclosing context to handle the error and decide how to proceed.
}
\description{
This function provides a mechanism to invoke a restart during the reading and
transformation process of the SeaSonde CS File Version 6 header. It allows users
to skip transformations that may have caused errors and proceed with a provided value.
}
\details{
This function specifically triggers the \code{seasonder_v6_skip_transformation} restart
that allows for skipping a block transformation in the reading process of the
SeaSonde CS File Version 6 header. When triggered, it logs an error message,
skips the problematic transformation, and returns the provided value for the block.
}
\section{Integration with SeaSonde CS File Reading}{


The restart mechanism of this function is integrated within the
\code{seasonder_readSeaSondeCSFileHeaderV6} function. If an error occurs during
the transformation process of a specific block, the restart provides users with
an option to skip the problematic transformation and proceed with a fallback value.
