\title{Convert Doppler Frequencies to Normalized Doppler Frequencies}
\usage{
seasonder_DopplerFreq2NormalizedDopplerFreq(seasonder_cs_obj, doppler_values)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_obj}{A \code{SeaSondeR} cross-spectral object containing metadata about the Doppler bins.}

\item{doppler_values}{A numeric vector specifying the Doppler frequencies (in Hz) to be converted into normalized Doppler frequencies.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of normalized Doppler frequencies corresponding to the input Doppler values.
}
\description{
This function converts Doppler frequencies (in Hz) into their corresponding normalized Doppler frequencies within a \code{SeaSondeR} object.
}
\details{
The function follows these steps:
\enumerate{
\item Calls \code{\link{seasonder_DopplerFreq2Bins}} to convert the input Doppler frequencies into Doppler bin indices.
\item Calls \code{\link{seasonder_Bins2NormalizedDopplerFreq}} to obtain the corresponding normalized Doppler frequencies.
}

The normalized Doppler frequency is computed as:
\deqn{f_{norm} = \frac{f_{doppler}}{f_{bragg}}}
where:
\itemize{
\item \( f_{norm} \) is the normalized Doppler frequency,
\item \( f_{doppler} \) is the Doppler frequency of a given bin,
\item \( f_{bragg} \) is the Bragg frequency, computed based on radar wavelength.
}

This function ensures consistency by mapping input frequencies to their closest bin representation before normalization.
