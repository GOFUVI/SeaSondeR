\title{Apply Amplitude and Phase Corrections to a SeaSonde RAPM Object}
\usage{
seasonder_applyAPMAmplitudeAndPhaseCorrections(seasonder_apm_object)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_apm_object}{A SeaSonde RAPM object containing raw data and correction factors.}
}
\value{
Returns the SeaSonde RAPM object with amplitude and phase corrections applied to the data.
}
\description{
This function applies amplitude and phase corrections to each antenna channel
of a SeaSonde RAPM object based on the specified corrections retrieved from the object.
The corrections are applied to the raw data matrix within the SeaSonde RAPM object.
