\title{Structured Restart for Quality Control}
\usage{
seasonder_rerun_qc_with_fun(cond, qc_fun)
}
\arguments{
\item{cond}{The condition object captured during the execution of the
\code{read_and_qc_field} function.}

\item{qc_fun}{An alternate quality control function to apply. This function should accept
the value from the field as its sole argument and return a QC-applied value.}
}
\value{
The value returned by the alternate QC function \code{qc_fun}.
}
\description{
Provides a structured restart mechanism to rerun the quality control (QC) function
with an alternative function during the execution of \code{read_and_qc_field}.
This allows for a flexible error recovery strategy when the initial QC function fails
or is deemed inadequate.
}
\details{
This function is meant to be used within custom condition handlers for the
\code{read_and_qc_field} function.
}
\seealso{
\code{\link{read_and_qc_field}} for more details on how this function fits
