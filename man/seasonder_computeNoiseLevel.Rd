\title{Compute Noise Level for First Order Region (FOR) Processing}
\usage{
seasonder_computeNoiseLevel(seasonder_cs_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_obj}{A \code{SeaSondeRCS} object containing spectral data and FOR parameters.}
}
\value{
The updated \code{SeaSondeRCS} object with the computed noise level stored in its attributes.
}
\description{
This function estimates the noise level in the self-spectra of a SeaSondeR cross-spectral object.
The noise level is computed by averaging the spectral power within a predefined frequency range
where no first-order Bragg signal is expected.
}
\details{
\strong{Steps in Noise Level Computation:}
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Determine Noise Reference Limits:}
\itemize{
\item Retrieves the normalized Doppler frequency limits for noise reference from \code{\link{seasonder_getSeaSondeRCS_FOR_parameters}}.
\item Converts these limits into Doppler bin indices using \code{\link{seasonder_SwapDopplerUnits}}.
\item Ensures that missing values are replaced with appropriate boundary values.
}
\item \strong{Extract Spectral Data for Noise Estimation:}
\itemize{
\item The function extracts self-spectra (SSA3) from antenna 3 using \code{\link{seasonder_getSeaSondeRCS_SelfSpectra}}.
\item The extraction is limited to the Doppler bins within the computed noise reference range.
}
\item \strong{Compute the Average Noise Level:}
\itemize{
\item The extracted spectral data from both negative and positive Doppler regions is concatenated.
\item The row-wise mean is computed to estimate the average noise level.
}
\item \strong{Store the Noise Level in the Object:}
\itemize{
\item The computed noise level is assigned to the \code{NoiseLevel} attribute of the SeaSondeRCS object.
}
}

The computed noise level is crucial in setting signal-to-noise thresholds used in first-order Bragg region detection.
