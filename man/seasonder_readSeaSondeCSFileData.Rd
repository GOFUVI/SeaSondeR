\title{Read SeaSonde Cross Spectra (CS) File Data}
\usage{
seasonder_readSeaSondeCSFileData(connection, header, endian = "big")
}
\arguments{
\item{connection}{A connection object to the CS file.}

\item{header}{A list containing the header information. This is typically the output
of the \code{seasonder_readSeaSondeCSFileHeader} function.}

\item{endian}{Character string indicating the byte order. Options are "big" (default) or "little".}
}
\value{
A list containing the matrices for \verb{SSA*}, \code{CSxy}, and \code{QC} (when applicable).
}
\description{
This function reads the SeaSonde CS file data based on the provided header information.
The CS file data includes the antenna voltage squared self spectra (\verb{SSA*}) and the
antenna cross spectra (\code{CSxy}). Additionally, a quality matrix (\code{QC}) is read when the header's
\code{nCsKind} is greater than or equal to 2.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \verb{SSA*}: Represents the Antenna * voltage squared self spectra. These are matrices
where each row corresponds to a range and each column to a Doppler cell.
\item \code{CSxy}: Represents the cross spectra between two antennas x and y. These are complex matrices.
\item \code{QC}: Quality matrix with values ranging from zero to one. A value less than one indicates
that the SpectraAverager skipped some data during averaging.
