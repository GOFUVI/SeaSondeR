\title{Reject Ionospheric Noise in SeaSonde Data}
\usage{
seasonder_rejectNoiseIonospheric(seasonder_cs_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_obj}{a SeaSonde cross-section object, which contains data for various ranges
and peaks that need processing.}
}
\value{
Returns the modified SeaSonde cross-section object with appropriate Bragg peaks rejected.
}
\description{
This function rejects negative and positive Bragg peaks when the total external (non-Bragg)
power is greater than the Bragg power by a specified dB amount. This is applied across each
range for both negative and positive Bragg peaks.
}
\details{
The function iterates over each range and applies a test to each negative and positive Bragg peak.
It uses the \code{seasonder_rejectNoiseIonosphericTest} function to evaluate whether the Bragg peak should
be rejected based on the comparison of Bragg and non-Bragg power levels.
