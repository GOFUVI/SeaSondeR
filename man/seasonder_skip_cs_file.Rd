\title{Skip SeaSonde Cross Spectra (CS) File Reading}
\usage{
seasonder_skip_cs_file(cond)
}
\arguments{
\item{cond}{The condition or error that occurred during the file reading process. This is used
to log a detailed error message indicating the reason for skipping the file.}
}
\value{
If invoked, the function returns a list with both \code{header} and \code{data} set to NULL.
}
\description{
This function serves as a restart for \code{seasonder_readSeaSondeCSFile}. When invoked, it provides a
mechanism to gracefully handle file reading errors by logging an error message and skipping the current file processing.
}
\details{
This function is meant to be used within a custom condition handler. When a problematic condition
arises during the processing of a SeaSonde CS file, you can call \code{seasonder_skip_cs_file(cond)} to
trigger this restart, which allows for a graceful degradation by logging an error message and skipping the file.

The effect of invoking this restart is twofold:
\enumerate{
\item An error message detailing the reason for skipping the file is logged.
\item The calling function (\code{seasonder_readSeaSondeCSFile}) will immediately return a list with \code{header=NULL} and \code{data=NULL}.
}
}
