\title{Calculate the Bragg Wavelength}
\usage{
seasonder_getBraggWaveLength(seasonder_cs_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_obj}{A \code{SeaSondeRCS} object containing the necessary data
to compute the radar wavelength.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the Bragg wavelength (\( \lambda_B \)) in meters.
}
\description{
This function computes the Bragg wavelength (\( \lambda_B \)) for a SeaSonde radar
system. The Bragg wavelength is defined as half the radar wavelength and is used
to identify the fundamental scattering mechanisms in oceanographic radar measurements.
}
\details{
The Bragg wavelength (\( \lambda_B \)) is calculated as:
[
\lambda_B = \frac{\lambda}{2}
]
where:
\itemize{
\item \( \lambda \) is the radar wavelength in meters, obtained using
\code{\link{seasonder_getRadarWaveLength}}.
}

The Bragg wavelength is a critical parameter in interpreting the resonance
scattering from the sea surface, which is fundamental to the operation of
HF radar systems.

# Assuming `cs_object` is a valid `SeaSondeRCS` object
