\title{Read a Body Range Cell and Apply Scaling if Required}
\usage{
seasonder_readBodyRangeCell(
  connection,
  specs,
  dbRef,
  endian = "big",
  specs_key_size = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{connection}{A binary connection from which keys and data are read.}

\item{specs}{A list that defines the expected keys and their formats.}

\item{endian}{A string specifying the byte order ("big" or "little").}

\item{specs_key_size}{Optional specification for the key size block.}
}
\value{
A list with elements named after the keys read. For reduced data blocks, each element contains either
raw decoded data or scaled voltage values if a 'scal' block was applied.
}
\description{
This function processes a block of keys from a binary connection according to a given specification ('specs').
Each key is read using seasonder_readSeaSondeCSFileBlock and processed based on its name.
}
\details{
Key processing details:
\itemize{
\item 'scal': Reads scaling parameters (fmax, fmin, fscale, dbRef) via seasonder_readCSSYFields and stores
them for use in scaling subsequent reduced data blocks.
\item Reduced data keys (e.g., 'cs1a', 'cs2a', etc.): Reads the data using seasonder_read_reduced_encoded_data.
If scaling parameters were set by a preceding 'scal' block, the raw data is transformed into voltage values
using seasonder_SeaSondeRCSSYApplyScaling; otherwise, the raw data is returned as is.
\item Other keys such as 'csgn' and 'asgn' invoke their own specialized read functions.
}

The function terminates when the 'END ' key is encountered or when a repeated key (e.g., 'indx') signals the end of
the block.
