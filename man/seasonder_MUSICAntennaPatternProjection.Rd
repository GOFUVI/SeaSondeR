\title{Compute Euclidean Distances for the MUSIC Algorithm}
\usage{
seasonder_MUSICAntennaPatternProjection(seasonder_cs_object)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_object}{A SeaSondeRCS object containing the MUSIC covariance matrix,
antenna pattern measurements (APM), and related metadata.}
}
\value{
The updated \code{seasonder_cs_object} with the calculated projections stored in
the MUSIC data. Each Doppler bin contains a 2xN matrix of distances, where:
\itemize{
\item Row 1 (\code{"single"}) corresponds to the projections for a single signal solution.
\item Row 2 (\code{"dual"}) corresponds to the projections for a dual signal solution.
}
}
\description{
This function computes the magnitude of the projection of each antenna pattern vector onto
the estimated noise subspace. These projections
are essential for identifying the direction of arrival (DOA) of signals, as the smallest
projection indicates the bearing of the signal.
}
\details{
The magnitude of the projection in the MUSIC algorithm quantifies how close the antenna manifold
vector is to the noise subspace. The algorithm projects each antenna pattern vector onto
the estimated noise subspace and calculates the magnitude of this projection. The bearing
with the smallest distance is considered the most likely direction of arrival for the signal.

The computation uses the formula:
\deqn{D_i = a^H (En E_n^H) a}

where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{a} is the complex antenna manifold vector for a given bearing.
\item \eqn{En} is the noise subspace eigenvector matrix.
\item \eqn{H} denotes the Hermitian (conjugate transpose) operator.
}

The projections are computed for both single and dual solutions. The dual solution considers
the noise subspace corresponding to two eigenvectors, whereas the single solution uses
one eigenvector.
