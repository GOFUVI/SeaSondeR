\title{Validate Calibration Matrix for a SeaSondeRAPM Object}
\usage{
seasonder_validateCalibrationMatrixSeaSondeRAPM(matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{A 3 x b complex matrix for calibration, where b is the number of bearings.}
}
\value{
TRUE if the matrix is valid. The function will stop execution and display an error message if the matrix is invalid.
}
\description{
This function validates the input calibration_matrix to ensure it meets the required specifications
for use in a SeaSondeRAPM object.
}
\details{
The function performs the following validation checks:
\enumerate{
\item Confirms that the input is a matrix.
\item Verifies that the matrix has exactly three rows.
\item Checks that the matrix contains only complex numbers.
}

If any of these validation steps fail, the function will log a fatal error and stop the execution using \code{rlang::abort}.
