\title{Convert Normalized Doppler Frequencies to Doppler Frequencies}
\usage{
seasonder_NormalizedDopplerFreq2DopplerFreq(seasonder_cs_obj, doppler_values)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_obj}{A \code{SeaSondeR} cross-spectral object containing metadata about the Doppler bins.}

\item{doppler_values}{A numeric vector specifying the normalized Doppler frequencies to be converted into Doppler frequencies (Hz).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of Doppler frequencies (in Hz) corresponding to the input normalized Doppler frequencies.
}
\description{
This function converts normalized Doppler frequencies into their corresponding Doppler frequencies (in Hz) within a \code{SeaSondeR} object.
}
\details{
The function follows these steps:
\enumerate{
\item Calls \code{\link{seasonder_NormalizedDopplerFreq2Bins}} to convert the input normalized Doppler frequencies into Doppler bin indices.
\item Calls \code{\link{seasonder_Bins2DopplerFreq}} to obtain the corresponding Doppler frequencies in Hz.
}

The relationship between the normalized and absolute Doppler frequencies is defined as:
\deqn{f_{doppler} = f_{norm} \times f_{bragg}}
where:
\itemize{
\item \( f_{doppler} \) is the Doppler frequency in Hz,
\item \( f_{norm} \) is the normalized Doppler frequency,
\item \( f_{bragg} \) is the Bragg frequency, computed based on radar wavelength.
}
}

\dontrun{
# Convert normalized Doppler frequencies to Doppler frequencies

normalized_values <- c(-0.3, 0, 0.6)  # Example normalized Doppler frequencies
doppler_freqs <- seasonder_NormalizedDopplerFreq2DopplerFreq(cs_obj, normalized_values)
print(doppler_freqs)
