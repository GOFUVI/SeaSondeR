\title{Calculate the Bragg Doppler Angular Frequency}
\usage{
seasonder_getBraggDopplerAngularFrequency(seasonder_cs_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_obj}{A \code{SeaSondeRCS} object containing the necessary data
to compute the radar wave number.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of length two, containing the negative and positive
Bragg Doppler angular frequencies (\( \omega_B \)), in radians per second.
}
\description{
This function computes the Bragg Doppler angular frequencies for a SeaSonde radar
system. These frequencies represent the characteristic Doppler shifts due to
wave resonance at the Bragg wavelength.
}
\details{
The Bragg Doppler angular frequency (\( \omega_B \)) is calculated using the formula:
[
\omega_B = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot g \cdot k}}{2 \pi}
]
where:
\itemize{
\item \( g \) is the gravitational acceleration (approximately \( 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)),
\item \( k \) is the radar wave number in radians per meter,
\item \( \pm \) represents the negative and positive directions of wave propagation.
}

The returned vector contains the negative (\( -\omega_B \)) and positive (\( +\omega_B \)) angular frequencies.
