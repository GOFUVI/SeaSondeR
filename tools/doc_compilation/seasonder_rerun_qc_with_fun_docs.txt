}
\arguments{
\item{cond}{The condition object captured during the execution of the

\description{
Provides a structured restart mechanism to rerun the quality control (QC) function
with an alternative function during the execution of \code{read_and_qc_field}.
This allows for a flexible error recovery strategy when the initial QC function fails
or is deemed inadequate.
}
\details{
This function is meant to be used within custom condition handlers for the
\code{read_and_qc_field} function.
