\title{Calculate Radial Velocities for Each Doppler Bin}
\usage{
seasonder_getBinsRadialVelocity(seasonder_cs_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_obj}{A SeaSondeRCS object created using \code{seasonder_createSeaSondeRCS}. This object
contains the necessary data for calculating the Doppler bins frequencies and, subsequently, radial velocities.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the radial velocities (in m/s) for each
Doppler bin, calculated for the high boundary of each Doppler bin interval.
The velocities provide insight into the scatterers' radial movement within the
radar's observation area.
}
\description{
Computes the radial velocities for each Doppler bin interval's high boundary
for a SeaSonde radar cross-section (CS) object, as typically visualized in
SpectraPlotterMap. This function utilizes the Doppler shift frequency alongside
the radar's wave number and Bragg frequency to transform frequency measurements
into radial velocities. The calculation is grounded on the relationship
between the Doppler shift frequency and the velocity of the surface currents
within the radar's field of view.
}
\details{
Specifically, the radial velocity \(v\) for each Doppler bin is calculated using the formula:
[
v = \frac{\text{Freq} - \text{BraggFreq}}{2 \cdot k_0}
]
where \(v\) is the radial velocity, \(\text{Freq}\) is the Doppler shift frequency for the bin, \(\text{BraggFreq}\) is the Bragg
frequency (negative for frequencies below 0 and positive for frequencies equal or above 0), and \(k_0\) is the radar wave number
divided by \(2\pi\).
