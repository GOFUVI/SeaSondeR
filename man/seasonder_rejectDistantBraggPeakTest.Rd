\title{Reject Distant Bragg Peaks}
\usage{
seasonder_rejectDistantBraggPeakTest(
  seasonder_cs_obj,
  peak,
  range = NA,
  peak_name = ""
)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_obj}{An object representing the current state of the radar cross section analysis,
expected to contain methods or properties needed to determine Bragg lines.}

\item{peak}{A numeric vector indicating the positions of the peak under consideration.}

\item{range}{Optional; A numeric or integer NA indicating the range over which to consider the peak.
Defaults to NA if not specified.}

\item{peak_name}{Optional; A character string representing the name or identifier of the peak.
Defaults to an empty string if not specified.}
}
\value{
Returns a possibly modified version of the \code{peak} argument, where a rejected peak
is returned as \code{integer(0)}, indicating that no valid peak is present.
}
\description{
This function evaluates Bragg peaks based on their proximity to expected Bragg line bins.
If the boundaries of a peak are farther from all Bragg lines than the width of the peak itself,
the peak is rejected by setting it to an empty integer vector.
}
\details{
The function computes the left and right limits of the given peak and checks if the distance
from these limits to the nearest Bragg lines exceeds the width of the peak. If both boundaries
exceed this threshold, the peak is rejected.
}
