\title{Validate Signal Matrix Power Ratios Using MUSIC Algorithm}
\usage{
seasonder_MUSICCheckSignalMatrix(seasonder_cs_object)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_object}{A SeaSondeRCS object containing the MUSIC solutions and related data.}
}
\value{
The updated SeaSondeRCS object with the following modifications:
\itemize{
\item A new column \code{diag_off_diag_power_ratio} in the MUSIC data.
\item A logical column \code{P3_check} indicating whether each solution passes the P3 test.
\item Updated \code{retained_solution} values for solutions that fail the test.
}
}
\description{
This function implements the P3 test for solutions derived using the MUSIC algorithm.
The test evaluates the ratio between diagonal and off-diagonal powers in the signal covariance matrix.
}
\details{
The P3 test evaluates the power ratio between diagonal (\(P_{\text{diag}}\)) and off-diagonal (\(P_{\text{off-diag}}\)) elements of the covariance matrix:
[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{P_{\text{diag}}}{P_{\text{off-diag}}}
]
This ratio is compared to a threshold defined in the MUSIC parameters. Only solutions that meet the following criteria are retained:
\itemize{
\item The solution has two bearings.
\item The power ratio is above the threshold.
}

Solutions failing this test are marked as "single."
