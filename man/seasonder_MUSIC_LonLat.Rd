\title{Convert MUSIC Algorithm Output to Geolocated Coordinates}
\usage{
seasonder_MUSIC_LonLat(seasonder_cs_object)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_object}{A complex SeaSondeR data object that includes both the MUSIC data
and the Antenna Pattern Matching (APM) data necessary for locating the source of the signals.}
}
\value{
Returns the modified \code{seasonder_cs_object} with MUSIC data updated to include longitude
and latitude coordinates for each detected signal.
}
\description{
This function takes the output from the MUSIC algorithm, typically used in direction finding
within the SeaSonde remote sensing system, and converts the directional data (range and bearings)
into geographic coordinates based on the originating radar site.
