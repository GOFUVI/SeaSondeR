\title{Run MUSIC Algorithm on FOR Data}
\usage{
seasonder_runMUSIC_in_FOR(seasonder_cs_object, doppler_interpolation = 2L)
}
\arguments{
\item{seasonder_cs_object}{A SeaSondeRCS object containing cross-spectrum data and initialized First Order Regions (FOR).}

\item{doppler_interpolation}{An integer specifying the level of interpolation to apply to Doppler bins. Default is \code{2L}.}
}
\value{
A SeaSondeRCS object with updated MUSIC data after applying the algorithm.
}
\description{
This function integrates the MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification) algorithm into a SeaSondeRCS object with First Order Regions (FOR).
It interpolates Doppler bins, extracts First Order Regions from the cross-spectrum data, and initializes MUSIC data for further processing.
}
\details{
This function follows these steps:
\enumerate{
\item Updates the SeaSondeRCS object with the specified Doppler interpolation level using \code{seasonder_setSeaSondeRCS_MUSIC_doppler_interpolation}.
\item Retrieves the FOR data from the input object using \code{seasonder_getSeaSondeRCS_FOR}.
\item Iterates over each range cell in the FOR, transforming negative and positive Doppler bins into their respective frequencies and applying the MUSIC algorithm.
\item Creates a data frame containing range cell and Doppler bin information for the MUSIC algorithm.
\item Initializes MUSIC data in the SeaSondeRCS object using \code{seasonder_initMUSICData}.
\item Applies the MUSIC interpolation and runs the MUSIC algorithm on the object.

# Assuming `cs_object` is a valid SeaSondeRCS object with FOR initialized
