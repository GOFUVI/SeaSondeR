\title{Calculate Euclidean Distances for MUSIC Algorithm}
\usage{
seasonder_MUSICEuclideanDistance(seasonder_cs_object)
}
\arguments{
\item{eigen_analysis}{A list containing the results of the eigenvalue decomposition of the MUSIC covariance
matrix. This list must have at least two elements: \verb{$values} for eigenvalues and \verb{$vectors} for
eigenvectors.}

\item{seasonder_apm_obj}{A matrix representing the antenna pattern measurements (APM), where each column
corresponds to a specific bearing and contains the complex-valued response of the antenna at that bearing.}
}
\value{
A 2xN complex matrix, where N is the number of bearings. The first row (\code{"single"}) contains the
Euclidean distances for the single solution scenario, and the second row (\code{"dual"}) for the dual
solution scenario, based on the eigenvalue decomposition and the antenna pattern measurements.
}
\description{
Computes the Euclidean distances based on the eigenvalue decomposition from the MUSIC covariance matrix and
the antenna pattern measurements (APM) for single and dual solutions.

\details{
The Euclidean distance in the context of the MUSIC algorithm is a measure used to estimate the direction
of arrival (DOA) of signals. This function computes these distances by projecting the antenna pattern measurements
onto the subspace orthogonal to the signal's eigenvectors (from the eigenvalue decomposition of the MUSIC covariance
matrix). The computation for \code{single} and \code{dual} solutions involves the use of eigenvectors corresponding to the
noise subspace (\code{En}). For each bearing, the function calculates the projected Euclidean distance using the formula:

\deqn{D_i = a^H (En E_n^H) a}

where \eqn{a} represents the complex-valued response of the antenna at a given bearing, \eqn{En} the matrix of
eigenvectors corresponding to the noise subspace, and \eqn{H} denotes the conjugate transpose. The distances are
calculated for both single and dual solutions, indicating scenarios with different numbers of signal sources.
